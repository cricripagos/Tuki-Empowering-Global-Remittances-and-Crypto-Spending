*Tuki - A Debit Card to Receive Stablecoin Remittances in Mexico*

*Executive Summary:*
Tuki aims to revolutionize remittances in Mexico by offering a debit card solution that allows individuals to receive stablecoin remittances from anywhere in the world. The project leverages the Rootstock ecosystem, including RIF Name Service, RIF Relay, and Identity, to enhance user experience, facilitate seamless transactions, and build a reputation score for the unbanked population. By tapping into the vast market of remittances and the unbanked population in Mexico, Tuki has the potential to make a significant impact on the web3/Bitcoin/Rootstock ecosystem.

*Project Overview:*
Tuki addresses the problem of inefficient and costly remittance processes in Mexico. With a substantial amount of remittances being sent to Mexico each quarter and a large population of unbanked individuals, there is a need for a secure and accessible solution to receive and utilize these funds. Tuki's solution is to provide virtual or physical debit cards to recipients after a quick KYC onboarding process. The stablecoin remittances can be used for everyday transactions, reducing the reliance on cash and empowering the unbanked population.

*Potential Impact:*
Tuki's solution has several potential impacts on the web3/Bitcoin/Rootstock ecosystem as well as the Mexican market. By leveraging Rootstock's technologies, Tuki enhances user experience through human-readable names, enables seamless payment of commissions or fees in ERC-20 stablecoins, and initiates the development of a reputation score for the unbanked population. This not only improves financial inclusion and access to digital services but also strengthens the adoption and utility of the Rootstock ecosystem. Furthermore, by partnering with mom and pop shops and reducing cash transactions, Tuki contributes to the modernization of Mexico's retail sector while addressing the needs of remittance recipients.

*Background & Context:*
The problem of inefficient remittance processes and limited financial inclusion is crucial to address in Mexico. In Q1 2023 alone, a significant amount of remittances, valued at 13.9 billion USD, was sent to Mexico. Additionally, the presence of over 12 million Mexicans living in the USA and the high rate of phone ownership with internet access (9 out of 10 Mexicans) creates a ripe market for innovative solutions. Furthermore, the 50 million unbanked individuals in Mexico demonstrate the need for accessible financial services that can empower this underserved population.

*Value Proposition:*
Tuki's solution stands out due to its innovative approach and various benefits. By offering a debit card for stablecoin remittance recipients, Tuki provides a secure, convenient, and fast method for individuals to receive and utilize funds. The integration of Rootstock's ecosystem, including RIF Name Service, RIF Relay, and Identity, enhances user experience, enables seamless transactions, and fosters the development of a reputation score for the unbanked population. Tuki's solution not only improves financial inclusion but also contributes to reducing cash transactions, thus modernizing the retail sector and promoting economic growth.

*Technical Description:*
Tuki's solution is built on the Rootstock ecosystem. RIF Name Service is utilized to enhance the user experience by providing human-readable names for easier identification and interaction. RIF Relay allows users to pay commissions or fees in any ERC-20 stablecoin, ensuring flexibility and compatibility. The integration of Identity enables Tuki to start building a reputation score for the unbanked population, establishing trust and enabling further financial opportunities. All these components are deployed on the secure Rootstock Blockchain. Additionally, Tuki leverages Pomelo as a Banking-as-a-Service platform to open accounts and issue debit cards.

*Market Analysis:*
Tuki's solution addresses a large market opportunity. With a staggering 13.9 billion USD of remittances sent to Mexico in Q1 2023, there is a significant potential market for Tuki's debit card solution. Moreover, with over 12 million Mexicans residing in the USA and 11.1 million Mexicans receiving remittances each month, there is a clear demand for accessible and efficient solutions to receive and utilize these funds. Tuki's integration with mom and pop shops, which represent 60% of sales in the country, creates an opportunity to onboard their customers and reduce cash transactions.

*Project Plan:*
To bring Tuki's idea to market, the following steps will be taken:
1. Develop and refine the user onboarding process, ensuring a seamless and efficient experience.
2. Establish partnerships with stablecoin providers and remittance platforms to facilitate the transfer and conversion of funds.
3. Expand the network of mom and pop shops, educating them about the benefits of Tuki and incentivizing them to onboard their customers.
4. Continuously enhance and optimize the Tuki platform based on user feedback and market needs.
5. Implement marketing and awareness campaigns to reach potential remittance senders and recipients, emphasizing the advantages of Tuki's solution.
