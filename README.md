### Phase I: Ideathon

**Executive Summary:**
Our proposal outlines the development of Tuki, a debit card solution designed to receive stablecoin remittances in Mexico. With over 12 million Mexicans living in the USA and a staggering $13.9 billion in remittances sent to Mexico in Q1 2023, there is a significant market opportunity for Tuki. By leveraging the Rootstock ecosystem, we aim to provide an innovative, convenient, and cost-effective solution to address the challenges faced by individuals receiving remittances in Mexico. Tuki will enable seamless remittance transfers, fast KYC onboarding, and the issuance of virtual or physical debit cards that can be used across Mexico. By partnering with mom and pop shops and reducing cash transactions, Tuki also aims to enhance financial inclusion and expand digital payments in the country.

**Project Overview:**
Tuki's objective is to facilitate the receipt of stablecoin remittances in Mexico through a user-friendly and efficient solution. The project aims to solve the challenge faced by Mexicans receiving remittances, provide a streamlined and secure process for onboarding, and offer a convenient debit card for everyday transactions. By leveraging the Rootstock ecosystem, Tuki can tap into the advantages of blockchain technology, such as improved UX with human-readable names, the ability to accept ERC-20 stablecoins as payment, and the potential to build a reputation score for the unbanked population. The impact of Tuki extends beyond remittances, as it strives to reduce the reliance on cash transactions and drive financial inclusion.

**Background & Context:**
Remittances play a vital role in the Mexican economy, with $13.9 billion sent to Mexico in Q1 2023. However, the current process of receiving remittances is often cumbersome and expensive, particularly for the unbanked population. Additionally, the prevalence of cash transactions limits the potential for digital payments and financial inclusion in the country. Tuki aims to address these challenges by offering a user-friendly solution that leverages stablecoins, streamlines onboarding through a quick KYC process, and provides a versatile debit card for everyday use.

**Value Proposition:**
Tuki's solution offers several key benefits to its target audience. Firstly, by accepting stablecoin remittances, Tuki eliminates the need for traditional, costly money transfer methods. With a fee of $3 per transaction under $400 or a 3% commission for higher amounts, Tuki provides a cost-effective alternative for remittance recipients. The issuance of virtual or physical debit cards enables recipients to conveniently access their funds and make purchases at any location within Mexico. By partnering with mom and pop shops, Tuki also taps into a vast network of community businesses, facilitating onboarding and driving the adoption of digital payments while reducing reliance on cash.

**Technical Description:**
Tuki is built on the Rootstock ecosystem, utilizing several RIF technologies to enhance its functionality. RIF Name Service improves the user experience by providing human-readable names for easier identification and transaction routing. RIF Relay enables users to pay fees or commissions in any ERC-20 stablecoin, increasing flexibility and accessibility. Identity solutions within the Rootstock ecosystem allow Tuki to establish a reputation score for the unbanked population, contributing to financial inclusion efforts. The entire system is deployed on the Rootstock Blockchain, ensuring security, transparency, and efficiency. Pomelo, a Banking as a Service platform, is utilized for account opening and card issuance.

**Market Analysis:**
The market opportunity for Tuki is significant, given the substantial volume of remittances sent to Mexico, reaching $13.9 billion in Q1 2023. With over 12 million Mexicans living in the USA and 11.1 million Mexicans receiving remittances monthly, Tuki addresses a large market. By providing a

 cost-effective and streamlined solution, Tuki aims to outperform existing competitors. Currently, the largest digital competitor, Bitso, holds only 4% of the market, indicating a vast untapped potential for Tuki's growth. By leveraging the Rootstock ecosystem and its associated benefits, Tuki differentiates itself from traditional remittance providers and offers unique advantages to its target audience.

**Project Plan:**
To bring Tuki to market, we will execute the following plan:
1. Develop the Tuki platform leveraging the Rootstock ecosystem and integrating RIF technologies.
2. Establish partnerships with mom and pop shops in Mexico to onboard their customers and encourage digital payments.
3. Conduct a comprehensive marketing campaign to raise awareness and promote Tuki as a cost-effective and convenient solution for receiving stablecoin remittances.
4. Roll out the virtual and physical debit card issuance process, enabling recipients to access their funds and make purchases.
5. Continuously enhance and iterate the Tuki platform based on user feedback and market dynamics.
6. Expand Tuki's user base and secure a significant market share by offering superior value compared to competitors.

**Team & Resources:**
Tuki's team consists of experienced professionals in blockchain technology, remittance services, and financial inclusion initiatives. The team has a deep understanding of the Mexican market and possesses the necessary technical expertise to leverage the Rootstock ecosystem effectively. To bring the idea to life, Tuki will require resources such as software development, marketing and advertising, partnerships with mom and pop shops, and operational infrastructure to support the issuance of debit cards. Tuki will utilize Pomelo as a Banking as a Service platform for account opening and card issuance, reducing the need for extensive banking infrastructure.

**Conclusion:**
Tuki's proposal outlines a solution to facilitate the receipt of stablecoin remittances in Mexico, leveraging the Rootstock ecosystem and associated RIF technologies. By providing a cost-effective, convenient, and secure platform, Tuki aims to address the challenges faced by Mexicans receiving remittances, while also driving financial inclusion and reducing reliance on cash transactions. With a substantial market opportunity, a competitive advantage over existing providers, and an experienced team, Tuki is poised to make a significant impact in the web3/Bitcoin/Rootstock ecosystem and contribute to the digital transformation of remittance services in Mexico.
